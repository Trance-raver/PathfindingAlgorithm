# A* Path Finding 
Developed a custom Grid System and implemented A* Pathfinding algorithm

## Description

Right Click : will place a black wall, algorithm won't be able to use that node

left click: Finds the path to corresponding node/box from Origin node. Origin node is at bottom left of the Grid


### Executing program

## Future

More algorithms and better visulization to come
